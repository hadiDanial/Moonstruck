Moonstruck - GitHub GameOff 2020

Moonstruck is a game about a forest dweller who finds a fallen moon spirit, and together they have to face the dark cult that is intent on destroying the moon, using various moon related powers and abilities, such as using moonlight to manipulate gravity, manifesting weapons made out of moonrock, and more.

The game will use a combination of A* and Node Canvas for AI.
